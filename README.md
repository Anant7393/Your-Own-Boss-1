## 👩‍ Overview
Creators face a major problem of managing deals & projects, accepting & managing payments, manage invoices, accept tips from fans, and many more.
we develop a solution for the creator economy which helps to manage their day-to-day task
and makes their life a lot simpler.
    
## 🔆 Tech Stack
The project is created using
-  JavaScript
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  Figma
-  Adobe Illustrator
-  Adobe After Effects

## 👬 Features
i) It provides a to-do list to the creators where he/she add his/her projects and a checklist if they have completed their project the can mark them Marked as done and then it will be remove from their to-do-list.They can also delete their project fromtheir list but before deleting a "Warning Pop-uP " comes to their screen.

  ii) The screen also has a clock which welcomes our user and show date and time and automatically keep updated second to second.
We all want someone to have  our back so it provides you with a feature of ADD A TEAM so that whenever the freelancer is in stress we can decrease his workload by adding a team so that whenever a freelancer is in stress we can decrease is workload by adding a team .   Now to add adding a team he can add any person across the globe and chat with them this provides other person an opportunity to showcase their talents and freelance to decrease his work.
 A lot many times under stress pressure we forget our deadlines so for that we have a feature which will provide reminders to creators whenever a deadline  is approaching now.
 Another major problem faced by the creator of freelancer is payment.
Major issues faced in payment such as-
1.	Heavy taxation
2.	Conversion fee while dealing with an international client
3.	Different modes of payment etc.
Our website uses 3 Gateways of Payment –
•	PAYPAL
•	WISE PAYMENT
•	PAYTM
Wise payment has a very low conversion speed that to is to be paid by the client not the creator , sO the salary of freelancer comes directly into account and convert into local currency automatically.
Also, Paypal generate invoices with salt and other challenge of “generating invoices”.



## 🚀 Future Plans
 1.  Adding a authorised video conferencing feature 
 2.  Using heatmap feature in hire a creator window to grab the interest and many more..
 3.  Adding virtual assistant using API and AI.
 4.  Giving Notification to the creators on their phone or mail about deadlines or projects.
 5.  Connecting with cloud for storing info about previous projects.
 6.  Adding some advance backend.
